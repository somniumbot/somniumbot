## Reporting a Vulnerability

Create a new issue with the title "[VULNERABILITY] (insert title here)" (obviously replace it with your own title)

Submit as much detailed info as possible, e.g. what type of vulnerability, where to find it, how it affects the codebase, possible fixes, etc. You get the idea.

If you don't want to wait, you can also create a pull request fixing the vulnerability and link to it in the issue.
